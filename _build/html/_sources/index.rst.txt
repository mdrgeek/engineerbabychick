Hello everyone welcome to my website!! I am EngineerBabychick!
==============================================================

Hi everybody! Here I am going to teach you about python3, Linux OS, Java, Bash, and a lot more. Let's start with python3!!!

Python3
=======

So I'm working on Linux Ubuntu so on Linux. Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, CentOS, Linux Mint; etc etc; come with python3 built in but if you want IDLE you intall it on Ubuntu with this command::

     babychick@babychick-engineerbabychick:~$ sudo apt-get install idle3
     
sudo apt-get install idle3 installs idle for you..

Let's get some work down!
-------------------------

OK, so search idle and then on those three greater than signs type in print("Hello world").

     >>> print("Hello world")
   
Basically you just told python to print hello world. We're going to use "print" in a lot of projects.
